# Intro

- Just a "Micky Mouse" experiment at this phase.
- Vagrant Ubuntu/Trusty64 VM.
- Installed DeepDive (by Standford HazyResearch) at the vagrant home directory (`/home/vagrant`).
- Enabled Windows SAMBA share. i.e. `\\192.168.33.10\deepdive` via Windows Explorer, is mapped to `` of the Ubuntu file-system. (Note: the static private IP address can be changed in `./vagrant/vagrantfile` if needed)
